Hi, I am Paula! I am a Data Scienist and work in the energy sector, using data to decarbonise buildings. I also live in a [housing cooperative](/why-I-live-in-a-coop) - would recommend, they are great! 

I have an MSc in Energy Systems and Data Analytics and BEng in Energy and Environmental Engineering. I worked at places like [Octopus Energy](https://octopus.energy/) and the [Energy Systems Catapult](https://es.catapult.org.uk/). Now, I am at [Building Atlas](https://www.buildingatlas.io/), helping to scale up retrofits for commertial buildings. 

This is me at the Porridge Making World Championships. (If you wonder what I am holding in my hand: It's a [Spurtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spurtle))
