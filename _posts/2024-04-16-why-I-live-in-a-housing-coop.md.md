title: why I live in a housing co-op

I used to live in the biggest student housing coop in the UK and I loved it! It was my first time living in a coop and it was pure luck. I met people who already lived there and it sounded fun, so I applied and got a spot. Only afterwards, I realised just how lucky I was. The waiting list was over 100 people long. This is not unusual - few coops exist, and they are popular, so they have long waiting lists. Setting up a new one usually takes years. 

In a housing coop, the members - the people living in the coop - self manage and democratically make decisions about their home. This gives us agency over our home. I have rented houses where I wasn't even allowed to put up a poster (which wasn’t my biggest problem when we had a mushroom growing between the floorboards). In our coop, we can paint walls, put up shelves, install a Japanese toilet or even a heat pump. We are keen to make these upgrades because we know that we won’t be kicked out by a landlord next month. 

Yes, you could buy a house and do the same. But I (and many others) don’t have the money to buy a house where I want to live. I also want to be flexible and not be bound by a crippling mortgage. And, I want to live with my friends. 

Living in a community is an active choice. I want to live with people I like - I don’t do it because I have to. Especially, in a city like London where some of my friends live over an hour away, having these regular and effortless, social interactions is incredibly important to me. I love coming home and having a random chat with my flatmates or joining in a meal they just made. 

Cooking for each other, and sharing meals is not just much more enjoyable than eating on my own, it is also extremely practical. Cooking a big dinner once a week, instead of 7 small ones, frees up lots of time for other things. It is also cheaper. 

Living in a coop doesn't necessarily mean sharing a flat - there are plenty of alternative coop architectures. Coops can consist of individual flats or houses with large communal spaces (like [this](https://coinstreet.org/about-us/our-developments/iroko-housing-co-op) or [this](http://www.laborda.coop/en/) one). 

Of course, it's not all just peace and pancakes - it is also work. When things break, you need to fix them. You need to communicate, discuss and negotiate with your housemates (or communal gardenmates). But it’s worth it. In the short run, it may be easier to live by yourself. No one is going to make a mess and no one can complain about the mess you’re making. But in the long run, it can be isolating. Living on your own might be easier - but it's also easier to only ever eat pizza and watch Netflix. 

If not actively practised in other environments, people unlearn (or never learn) how to communicate their needs and listen to others. Communal living is valuable at a scale beyond personal wellbeing. It teaches us skills of communication, cooperation and solidarity. We could do with a cultural shift towards a more bottom-up way of organising our society - a society where individuals are empowered to contribute. Housing cooperatives are a great place to start. To live in a coop is to live in a community, empowered to make our house feel like home.
