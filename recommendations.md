A couple of books, blogs & podcast that I recommend.  


## Read

**Hannah Ritchie's substack [Sustainability by Numbers](https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/)** provides an excellent zoomed-out and data-driven perspecitve on energy and environmental issues. I've been following it for years. 

## Listen 

**Stephen West's [Philosophize This!](https://www.philosophizethis.org/)** is the most fun, engaging and accessible philosophy podcast that I know. Again, have been listening to it for years. 

## Do 

**A [Vipassana](https://www.dhamma.org/en/index) course**, a 10 day silent meditation retreat - read about my experience [here]().
